# **Informational Interview**

Questions for asking a new connection - 

- What are some interesting aspects of your job?
- Any advice for someone looking to enter the field?
- How relevant was your education in getting this job?
- What other careers did you consider?
- How do you approach professional development in this field?
- What are you doing to keep your skills up-to-date?
- What do you wish you knew before you entered this field?

Finally, make it a goal to leave a positive impression. Even if your new contact isn’t able to directly help you advance in your job search right now, you never know when they may think of you for a future opportunity.
