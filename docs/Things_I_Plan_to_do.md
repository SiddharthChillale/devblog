#  :checkered_flag: Bucket List 

* [ ]   :hourglass_flowing_sand: C++ Game Programming:

    This is because I cannot learn something without having some knowledge of its application. I have to overcome the fear of C++ which I will do thanks to this.

    I'm learning it through this tutorial by [Chilli Tomato Noodle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwuIEMUFUnQ&list=PLqCJpWy5FohcehaXlCIt8sVBHBFFRVWsx&index=1). Currently, I'm just binging through it, consuming it like some Netflix Show, haha. 

* [ ]   PyGame Programming.

* [ ]   Making a Game using Godot Engine.

* [x]   Making a Portfolio Website with Blog:

    Already Created the portfolio. *(DevBlog for this project comming soon...)*

* [ ]   Making a website for my Mum's Business.
