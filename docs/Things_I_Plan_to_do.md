#  :checkered_flag: Bucket List 

* [x]   :hourglass_flowing_sand: C++ Game Programming (Binging):

    This is because I cannot learn something without having some knowledge of its application. I have to overcome the fear of C++ which I will do thanks to this.

    I'm learning it through this tutorial by [Chilli Tomato Noodle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwuIEMUFUnQ&list=PLqCJpWy5FohcehaXlCIt8sVBHBFFRVWsx&index=1). Currently, I'm just binging through it, consuming it like some Netflix Show, haha. 


* [ ]   Making a Game using Godot Engine (MAJOR GOALS).

* [x]   Making a Portfolio Website with Blog:

    Already Created the portfolio. *(DevBlog for this project comming soon...)*

* [ ]   Making a website for my Mum's Business or something to improve the business image.

* [ ]   Learn how to juggle (don't ask, it's just something I want to do)

* [x]   Get the Gold Badge in Hackerrank for C++ (It's an incentive to learn C++ properly, and pretty proud of it).

* [ ]   Reading Goals - ( Hands-On ML with Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow), followed by detailed projects.

* [ ]   Progress to Kaggle Notebooks Expert. 

* [ ]   Build a C++ Application. (still have to decide on which one. If you have any ideas, hit me up on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/siddharth-chillale-in/))
