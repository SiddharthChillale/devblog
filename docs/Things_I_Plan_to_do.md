#  :checkered_flag: Bucket List 

* [x]   :hourglass_flowing_sand: C++ Game Programming (Binging):

    This is because I cannot learn something without having some knowledge of its application. I have to overcome the fear of C++ which I will do thanks to this.

    I'm learning it through this tutorial by [Chilli Tomato Noodle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwuIEMUFUnQ&list=PLqCJpWy5FohcehaXlCIt8sVBHBFFRVWsx&index=1). Currently, I'm just binging through it, consuming it like some Netflix Show, haha. 


* [x]   Making a Game using Godot Engine (MAJOR GOALS).
    Update [July 2020]: Realy proud that I completed this. Finally created a 2D platform Game titled "Blocky's Revenge" where a blocky dude seeks out to avenge his beloved TV that the roundy dudes destroyed (an oscar-worthy story, believe me). I created the player, enemies and some of the background art. I am very proud of it and so happy that I finally saw this to the end. Anyway, the link for the game is here --> [Blocky's Revenge](https://siddharthchillale.itch.io/blockys-revenge). It can be played on windows, linux, android and macbook (I didn't test for the linux and mac versions though)

* [x]   Making a Portfolio Website with Blog:

    Already Created the portfolio. *(DevBlog for this project comming soon...)*

* [ ]   Making a website for my Mum's Business or something to improve the business image.
    Update [July 2020]: We gave up on the idea of making a website as it was not worth the effort according to the value it provided. Instead, I assisted with marketing of the products and eventually worked on editing her cooking videos to perfection.

* [ ]   Learn how to juggle (don't ask, it's just something I want to do)

* [x]   Get the Gold Badge in Hackerrank for C++ (It's an incentive to learn C++ properly, and pretty proud of it).

* [ ]   Reading Goals - ( Hands-On ML with Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow), followed by detailed projects.
