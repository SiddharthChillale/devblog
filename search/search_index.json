I'm a student pursing Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering at Indian Institute of Information Technology, Trichy. Over a period of three years, I've developed my developing skills through participating and co-hosting coding competitions. My recent love for pulling insights from raw data has led me to develop a dashboard running data analysis and showcasing affected numbers during the COVID-19 crisis. My latest web app project is a dashboard ruuning data analysis and showcasing affected numbers during the COVID-19 crisis. Apart from my academics, I'm working on helping with the COVID research by running models on the gathered data. Currently, I am volunteering as a Teaching Assistant at \"ShiP.py: Learning to Py while Shelter-in-Place\" to offer a Free, Online, Interactive, and Hands-on beginner's programming course in Python. In my free time, I continue improving my skills by applying my knowledge contesting in Kaggle competitions. In my more free times, Photography, Sketching and Painting makes me happy.

Since we are focusing only on the trend, we do not require exact numbers. Therefore, a rolling mean of 5 values is implemented to smoothen out the irregularities. Initial Added a graph plotting new cases to existing cases. The Graph is number of New cases per Total number of cases. In order to understand exponential growths for diseases, we must not plot the growth against time (which is not so useful in prediction) ; but with the total existing numbers. 1 A fall in the graph indicates lowering of new cases with total cases. i.e. We see that China and Korea are out of the danger of new cases. Italy and Spain are seeing small rates of controling the virus. Axes are plotted on logarithmic scale. Version 2.0 Date: March 23-27, 2020 \u00b6 Updates Added a Death Count Graph. Changed the theme of the dashboard to look more presentable. Added functionality of updating data in every refresh or at intervals of 6 hours.

Currently, I'm just binging through it, consuming it like some Netflix Show, haha. Making a Game using Godot Engine (MAJOR GOALS). Update [July 2020]: Realy proud that I completed this. Finally created a 2D platform Game titled \"Blocky's Revenge\" where a blocky dude seeks out to avenge his beloved TV that the roundy dudes destroyed (an oscar-worthy story, believe me). I created the player, enemies and some of the background art. I am very proud of it and so happy that I finally saw this to the end. Anyway, the link for the game is here \u2192 Blocky's Revenge .
